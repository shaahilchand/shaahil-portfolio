            <p class="about-paragraph">2016 - Graduated from St Pauls Catholic College, Greystanes. <br>2017 (first-half) - Basically did odd jobs here and basically finding myself and figuring out what I wanted to pursue career wise. <br>2017 (second-half) - Came to the conclusion that I wanted to help people and enrolled in a Diploma in Case Management to become a psychiatrist. Also coming to the realisation that I didn't enjoy or see myself pursuing mental health as a career. <br> 2018 - Following the band wagon of Elon Musks godlike personality I found myself enrolling in a Diploma of Engineering at Western Sydney College where I learnt many founational engineering principles such as very basic c++, where the logic aspect was really attractive to me. <br>2019 - After the Diploma in Engineering I found myself leaning towards programming but I didn't have much solid experience in all aspects and languages, so I enrolled in Coder Academy, which had been a thoroughly enjoyable expereince which has taught me programming in an in-depth perspective straight from the horeses mouth of everyday coders.</p>
